# jQuery
jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax.

# Adding jQuery to Your Web Pages
- Download the jQuery library from jQuery.com
- Include jQuery from a CDN, like Google

# Downloading jQuery
There are two versions of jQuery available for downloading:
- Production version - this is for your live website because it has been minified and compressed
- Development version - this is for testing and development (uncompressed and readable code)

Both versions can be downloaded from [jquery.com](https://jquery.com/).

The jQuery library is a single JavaScript file, and you reference it with the HTML <code><script></code> tag (notice that the <code><script></code> tag should be inside the <code>head</code> section):
  
```html
<head>
<script src="jquery-3.5.1.min.js"></script>
</head>
```
