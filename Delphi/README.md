# Delphi   
Delphi is a software product that uses the Delphi dialect of the Object Pascal programming language and provides an integrated development environment (IDE) for rapid application development of desktop, mobile, web, and console software, currently developed and maintained by Embarcadero Technologies.

Delphi's compilers generate native code for Microsoft Windows, macOS, iOS, Android and Linux (x64).



## Example   
This program, saved to a file named HelloWorld.dpr, compiles to a console application that prints "Hello World" to the console:   

```delphi
    program HelloWorld;

    {$APPTYPE CONSOLE}

    begin
    WriteLn('Hello World');
    end.

```
