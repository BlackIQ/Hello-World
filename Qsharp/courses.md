#### Microsoft launched the Quantum Development Kit across various platforms to help developers get started with quantum development. Come join John Azariah, a Principle Engineer from our quantum team, as he walks you through building your first quantum program in Q#, the only native programming language for quantum development. You will learn how to use Visual Studio along with the Quantum Development Kit to build your quantum solution and test it on the local simulator.
