# Mql4
The MetaQuotes Language 4 (MQL4) is an object-oriented high-level programming language intended for writing automated trading strategies, custom technical indicators for the analysis of various financial markets. It allows not only to write a variety of expert systems, designed to operate in real time, but also create their own graphical tools to help you make trade decisions.

MQL4 is based on the concept of the popular programming language C++. The language has enumerations, structures, classes and event handling. By increasing the number of embedded main types, the interaction of executable programs in MQL4 with other applications through dll is now as easy as possible. MQL4 syntax is similar to the syntax of C++, and this makes it easy to translate into it programs from modern programming languages.
