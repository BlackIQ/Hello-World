## Clipper
Clipper was a language made for MS DOS in 1985. Between 1985 and 1992 millions of programs were made in clipper with the main purpose of database management.
However clipper failed to make the jump from MS DOS to Windows and as a result next to no applications were developed in clipper after 1995.
