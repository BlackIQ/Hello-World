Carbon Language : An experimental successor to C++

Carbon, or Carbon-Lang, is an experimental, general-purpose programming language created to be a "C++ successor". The project is open-source and was started by Google, following in the footsteps of previous Google-made programming languages (Go and Dart). Google engineer Chandler Carruth first introduced Carbon at the CppNorth conference in Toronto in July of 2022.

The language intends to fix several perceived shortcomings of C++[4] but otherwise provides a similar feature set. The main goals of the language are readability and "bi-directional interoperability", as opposed to using a new language like Rust (which, while being based on C++, is not compatible with C++ programs). Changes to the language will be decided by the Carbon leads.

Carbon's documents, design, implementation, and related tools are hosted on GitHub under the Apache-2.0 license with LLVM Exception.
