# Solidity

Solidity is a statically-typed programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is used to implement smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, most notably Ethereum. Solidity is influenced by C++, Python, and JavaScript and is designed to target the EVM.

## Key Features
- Contract-oriented language
- Supports inheritance and libraries
- Statically typed with support for complex user-defined types
- Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) integration
