# VB
Visual Basic is a third-generation event-driven programming language from Microsoft known for its Component Object Model (COM)
programming model first released in 1991 and declared legacy during 2008. Microsoft intended Visual Basic to be relatively
easy to learn and use. Visual Basic was derived from BASIC and enables the rapid application development (RAD)
of graphical user interface (GUI) applications, access to databases using Data Access Objects, Remote Data Objects,
or ActiveX Data Objects, and creation of ActiveX controls and objects.
