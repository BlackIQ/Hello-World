# Scala

[Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) combines object-oriented and functional programming in one concise, high-level
language. Scala's static types help avoid bugs in complex applications, and its JVM and JavaScript runtimes let you
build high-performance systems with easy access to huge ecosystems of libraries.
