# PureScript : (A strongly-typed functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript.)

## PureScript is a strongly-typed, purely-functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript. It can be used to develop web applications, server side apps, and also desktop applications with use of Electron. Its syntax is mostly comparable to that of Haskell. 

# BENEFITS
*Compile to readable JavaScript and reuse existing JavaScript code easily
*An extensive collection of libraries for development of web applications, web servers, apps and more
*Excellent tooling and editor support with instant rebuilds
*An active community with many learning resources
*Build real-world applications using functional techniques and expressive types, such as:
...Algebraic data types and pattern matching
...Row polymorphism and extensible records
...Higher kinded types
...Type classes with functional dependencies
...Higher-rank polymorphism
