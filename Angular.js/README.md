# Angular.js

AngularJS is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web framework for developing single-page applications. 
It is maintained mainly by Google and a community of individuals and corporations. 
It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectures, along with components commonly used in web applications and progressive web applications.
