# Blender
Blender has an embedded Python interpreter which is loaded when Blender is started and stays active while Blender is running.
Blender provides its Python modules, such as bpy and mathutils , to the embedded interpreter so they can be imported into a script and give access to Blender's data, classes, and functions.
